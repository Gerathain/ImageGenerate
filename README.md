# ImageGenerate
This is a stochastic hill climbing algorithm to randomly alter a set of polygons in order to try and make them look like a target image

This program requires libcairo2-dev in order to build

Multimona.c is the same as Mona.c however it has been edited in order to take take advantage of multithreading.

In order to build Multimona.c, run the MakeFile (simply edit the Makefile and change "Multimona.c" to "Mona.c" to build mona.c)

Thanks to Nick Welch for the base code
